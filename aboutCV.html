Sarah Keeling is a multidisciplinary artist whose work considers the landscape, both natural and built. She looks at design as a set of instructions and creates intuitive responses through photography, video, sculpture and public works. The images and objects she creates combine familiarity and humor to make comedic yet contemplative works. She currently resides in Pittsburgh PA and holds a BFA from Carnegie Mellon University.  
<br>
<br>


Her work has been exhibited at ISEA2015 Vancouver, Canada; Bronco Gallery Portland, OR; the Queens Museum, Queen, NY; the Visual Studies Gallery, University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY; 973 Liberty Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA; the Billboard Project and the West Virginia University Arts Museum & Educational Center.

 <!-- <p title="Artist Statement">My work expresses an interest in the built environment and seeks to produce playful variations that more closely represent my own experiences and desires within it. I am curious what can be revealed about us through studying the structures created to facilitate particular functions, such as living space, places of work and commercial centers. These areas are constructed to fulfill a purpose and my interest lies in examining the rationale behind their forms. Is something altered, implied or possibly even transmitted in the translation from the originating "need" to the structural response intended as its answer? I hope to question our reaction to the design of these spaces and how they may influence our interactions by attempting to shift the perception of them.  -->
<!--I recently graduated with a BFA from Carnegie Mellon University and have exhibited in venues such as the Visual Studies Gallery at the University of Buffalo, NY; the WV University Arts Museum, WV; and the Queens Museum, NY. </p> -->
